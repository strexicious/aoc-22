# Advent of Code 2022

The repository contains my solutions to some of the challenges of AoC 2022.

Originally I wrote my solutions using ipynb because of it's fast feedback. The
python source files here are just copy-pasted from those notebooks and may need
a little bit of fixing if you want to execute them yourself.

Have fun! :)
